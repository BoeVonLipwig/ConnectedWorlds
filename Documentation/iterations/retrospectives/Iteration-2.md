## Tasks for next iteration

[Found here](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/ENGR301-302-2018/Project-10/VR-Network-Vis/milestones/6)

## Notes

We found that we did not meet the deadline for the milestone (see above image)for two reasons. The first was because we assigned ourselves too much work. We had too little work in the iteration before and aimed to fix this for this iteration. The second reason was that we where pivoting the direction of the project somewhat and needed to make time for replanning the next set of tasks and iterations. We expected to miss this milestone due to the planning and trimming we did. However this was important because this resulted in the cutting off of redundant tasks (such as creating an intermediate step in the parsing of CSV to the web server in JSON) and significantly better clarity of information in the team, as it had everyone involved in the making of the plan and allowed for needed information to be spread (see the removal of the web-hook related tasks that are not needed for our project). We have moved the unfinished tasks from iteration 2 to iteration 3 as planed last iteration.
They now look like this ass opposed to what is shown above:

Making better use of time estimates is a goal for this iteration as we found our selves often under spending on tasks.

Everyone attended all lab sessions, excluding Jacob who was away for one session due to illness.

Kyle felt that he was assigned a reasonable amount of work as he finished his contribution for the issues. Although more solid planning about the CSV data design would have put us in a better place. We did spend a lab session re-planning.

Shaun spent almost the entire time doing whiteboard planning and setting up services for the CI side of the project. He was pleased as he appreciates the organisational side of the project and felt that a significant amount was achieved in doing so. Shaun was also disappointed in his own miscommunication with the team on getting permission for hosting the project on surge.sh which resulted in the creation of the site prior to explicit permission being given. 

Rhys helped with the planning of how data should be stored and loaded. He is fairly happy that we are now in a good place to push forward with implementing it, however Rhys thinks we need to do a better job of splitting up different tasks so not everyone ends up working on the same thing.

Will did a lot of whiteboard planning for the CSV parser and how we would structure the files for generic data usage of the application (#76 and #77). He was annoyed that he didn't make as many code commits this iteration.

---------------------------

Jacob was not present so we cannot fill in his thoughts.

We will forward relevant incomplete issues to the next iteration. Please visit the milestones to view the carried over and new issues to do.
